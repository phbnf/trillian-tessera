# AWS Conformance Configs

Work in progress.

## Prequisites

You'll need to have configured the right IAM permissions to create S3 buckets
and RDS databases, and configured a local AWS profile that can make use of
these permissions. For instance, 

TODO(phboneff): establish what's the minimum set of permissions we need, and list
them here.

## Manual deployment

Configure an AWS profile on your workstation using your prefered method, (e.g
[sso](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html)
or [credential
files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-configure-files.html))

Set the required environment variables:
```bash
export AWS_PROFILE={VALUE}
```

Optionally, customize the AWS region (defaults to "us-east-1"),
base name, and prefix for resources (defaults to "conformance" and "tdev"):
```bash
export AWS_REGION={VALUE}
export TESSERA_BASE_NAME={VALUE}
export TESSERA_PREFIX_NAME={VALUE}
```

Resources will be named using a `${TESSERA_PREFIX_NAME}-${TESSERA_BASE_NAME}`
convention.

Terraforming the project can be done by:
 1. `cd` to the relevant directory for the environment to deploy/change (e.g. `ci`)
 2. Run `terragrunt apply`
